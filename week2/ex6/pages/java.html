        <h1>Java</h1>

        <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, memory-safe, object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[18] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
